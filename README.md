# Algorithmic-Portraits

This thesis explores the impact of algorithmic recommendation systems on personal taste formation, with a specific focus on YouTube as a primary content platform. The study investigates the ways in which algorithmic feeds influence consumption and examines the challenges to user agency within these environments. A human-centred co-design research approach was employed which identified three key barriers to user agency: dissociation from consumed content, the opacity of recommender systems, and the absence of a temporal context in content consumption. To address these challenges, the research introduces "Algorithmic Portraits," an interactive tool that visualises users' YouTube watch history alongside algorithmic inferences of their interests using Large Language Models (LLMs). The tool enables users to explore their content consumption patterns over time and critically reflect on their taste-making process. The results demonstrate that Algorithmic Portraits helps users recall dissociated memories of content consumption, examine algorithmic inferences critically, and recontextualise their online behaviour into qualitative narratives for self-reflection. This study contributes to the field of Critical Algorithmic Literacy (CAL) by providing a framework for visualising and interrogating algorithmically curated taste development. Future research could explore the integration of Algorithmic Portraits across multiple platforms to further enhance user agency in digital environments.
